### R fundamentals 03: Elements of programming, R Markdown  (`r format(Sys.Date(), "%b %d, %y")`)
[random header level 3]
---

As the last part of R fundamentals series, we will study elements of R programming and R markdown.

---

In this expression below, we can set the default chunk options for the rest of the document
Please note that this chunk itself is defined as `include=FALSE`, means, please evaluate it but no output of any type please!


```{r setDefault, include=FALSE}
# This code chunk defines the default chunks setting
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE, comment="$$$", fig.width=6)
```

>
> This is the place where we supposed to get the output of the first chunk
>

### Conditional statements and operators in R  
[Header of level 3]

Here, since this is just an example and not a real code, I left it with the default chunk options, e.g. with `eval=FALSE`  
However, I gave this chunk a name, called it "basicIf"

```{r basicIf}
  if (condition) {
    expression
  }
```

##

Here, I want to run the code and see the output, therefore `eval=TRUE`

```{r eval=TRUE, comment="Console says:"}
  # Assign x to -8
  x <- -8
  # Print if x is negative
  if (x < 0) {
    print("x is a negative number")
  }
```

##

Here is an example of how to use HTML tags within an Rmarkdown document:  
(astricks are used to form an unordered list - the empty line here below is mandatory!)

* `<br>` is a tag that forces a new line (a break)
* `<span>` allows to define a local text style

<br>
<span style="color:blue">**Classwork/Homework**</span>: Change x to 5 and re-run the above code. What does that print?

<br>

##


Here, again, I'm not interested in the output so I leave it with the default chunk options, e.g. with `eval=FALSE`


```{r}
  if (condition 1) {
    expression
  } else if (condition 2) {
    expression
  } else {
    expression
  }
```

##

Here I changed the way the output is indicated, prompt it with "Console says:"

```{r eval=TRUE, comment="Console says:"}
  # Assign x to 6
  x <- 6
  # Check if x is divisible by 2 or 3, if so print it is
  # Otherwise print it is not
  if (x %% 2 == 0) {
    print("x is divisioble by 2")
  } else if(x %% 3 == 0) {
    print("x is divisible by 3")
  } else {
    print("x is neither divisible by 2 nor 3")
  }
```

 
<br><br>  
  
### Output formating:  
  
<small>**Example1:** each line generates its own output and ploted in this order, each in a box of its own <br>
(since our `opts_chunk$set` indicates `eval=FALSE` we need to specify `eval=TRUE`;  echo = TRUE is a default)</small>

```{r eval=TRUE}
  # Check the quality of logical objects
  TRUE == FALSE
  # Compare strings
  "hi" == "hello"
  # Check inequlaity
  2 != 3
```

##

<small>**Example2:** all commands and their outputs are merged into one compact box</small>
```{r eval=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
  # Check the quality of logical objects
  TRUE == FALSE
  # Compare strings
  "hi" == "hello"
  # Check inequlaity
  2 != 3
```

##

<small>**Example3:** all outputs are gathered, printed at the end of the chunk</small>
```{r eval=TRUE, results='hold'}
  # Check the quality of logical objects
  TRUE == FALSE
  # Compare strings
  "hi" == "hello"
  # Check inequlaity
  2 != 3
```

#### R Markdown

R Markdown is a writing tool that allws us to write pain texts while the formating is kind of taken care by the system. Helps focussing on the content than on formatting - which is extremely important. Several cool features including adding math equations (latex). 

##

R Markdown combines best features of programming elements:

Why write in R Markdown?

* Formatting stays where it should

* Fast typing - no mouse required

* Easy to read and edit when marked up

* Allows good logical division of the document

* More than anything **REPRODUCIBLE!!!**

---

##### R markdown options

It is possible to control the behavior of each code chunk by providing a set of keywords.
Let's go over them in section 5 of the [Rmarkdown cheatsheet](rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf):

<center> ![](RmdCheatsheet-sec5.PNG) </center>

---

Here is a two levels unordered list:

* results: ('markup'; character) takes these possible values

    + markup: mark up the results using the output hook, e.g. put results in a special LaTeX environment
    + asis: output as-is, i.e., write raw results from R into the output document
    + hold: hold all the output pieces and push them to the end of a chunk
    + hide: hide results; this option only applies to normal R output (not warnings, messages or errors)
    
* comment: Comment character to preface results with (related to eval=TRUE of course)

---

It is possible to define a global (default) behavior for the code chunks (preferably at the begining) by the following format:  
[empty line below is not optional!]

> knitr::opts_chunk$set()

Example: 
`knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment=NA, fig.width=6)`

See 

> \> ?opts_knit

for the alternative approach to setting package options

---

**Note**: Never ever change directories in R Markdown documents - just don't do it. 

You need to put all images inside the folder you are working on to include in the R Markdown document. 

---

It also renders the final report in different formats:

Here, I want to load the HANES dataset, but don't want to show all the process of loading the data...  

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
  # Install RCurl package and load the package
  
  pkgTest <- function(x)
  {
    if (!require(x,character.only = TRUE))
    {
      install.packages(x,dep=TRUE)
        if(!require(x,character.only = TRUE)) stop("Package not found")
    }
  }

  pkgTest("RCurl")
  library(RCurl)
  # Import the HANES data set from GitHub; break the string into two for readability
  # (Please note this readability aspect very carefully)
  URL_text_1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kannan-kasthuri/kannan-kasthuri.github.io"
  URL_text_2 <- "/master/Datasets/HANES/NYC_HANES_DIAB.csv"
  # Paste it to constitute a single URL 
  URL <- paste(URL_text_1, URL_text_2, sep="")
  HANES <- read.csv(text=getURL(URL))
```

##

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
  # Plot LDL values vs HDL values
  plot(HANES$LDL, HANES$HDL)
```
